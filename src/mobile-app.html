        <h2 class="h2">Why choose ITgenus for mobile app design?</h2>
        <p>Our work ensures that our custom-designed mobile apps are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Unique — your individual requirements and objectives require an individual solution;</li>
          <li>Balanced — usability and aesthetics are both our top priorities;</li>
          <li>Platform specific — our applications comply with the native design patterns of iOS and Android;</li>
          <li>Optimisation for every device — our apps are visually stunning on every device, automatically adjusting for different screen sizes and aspect ratios.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To be noticed, you need an app that stands out. There are millions of apps on the market, on both major platforms, mostly indistinguishable from one another. App users will only give up their hard-earned space to a limited number of applications. Any that don't meet their needs are swiftly discarded and forgotten.</p>
        <p>Ensure you have an app with staying power; one that keeps users engaged for a longer period of time. Working with ITgenus provides you with the opportunity to design a mobile application that not only achieves your goals but also keeps users returning for more content.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for a professional custom mobile application design team to outsource your work to, then your search is at an end.</p>
